Each alpha encapsulates a unique hypothesis derived from my unique perspective on quantitative research, implemented using predictive signals on US financial markets.

🔍 What's Inside:

🧠 Custom alpha formulas with mathematical intuition

📊 Strategy explanations and thought processes

⚙️ Implementation logic and performance considerations

🧪 Insights from backtesting and refinement iterations
